    <h1>Coding a simple calculator in PureScript</h1>
    <p>
      I feel like everyone should write a toy programming language at least once
      in their lives. If you do, you might get drawn into the rabbit hole of adding
      features, syntax sugar, a compiler, a REPL, etc. etc., and along the way
      you'll probably learn a lot about language design.
    </p>
    <p>
      This post isn't about implementing a toy programming language, but rather
      something a little simpler: a calculator. While it might not be Turing
      complete, it touches on many of the same concepts (lexing, parsing, type
      checking, evaluating, etc). And in the process, we'll become familiar with
      a lot of what makes Purescript's ecosystem so great, from parser combinators,
      to pure and functional error handling, to pattern matching and more.

    <h2>Preliminaries</h2>
    <p>
      I'll assume you have Purescript, bower and pulp installed. Let's start by
      making a new project directory:
      <code>&gt; mkdir calculator &amp;&amp; cd calculator</code>
      Then we'll initialize the project with some defaults:
      <code>&gt; pulp init</code>
      <code>&gt; bower i --save purescript-parsing purescript-maps purescript-simple-repl</code>
    </p>
