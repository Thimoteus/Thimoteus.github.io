* [SandScript](http://www.github.com/thimoteus/SandScript): a lisp interpreter that runs on Node and on the web. This is the result of going through [Write Yourself a Scheme](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours), but adapting it for use in Purescript instead of Haskell. Differences include using a proper map type instead of an association list for the environment, pure state instead of effectful, mutable references, and a polymorphic base monad.
* [purescript-hugenums](http://www.github.com/thimoteus/purescript-hugenums): a Purescript library for correct computing with arbitrarily large or small numbers. Numbers are represented in big-endian form as a product of a) a list of digits, and b) the position of the decimal. Addition is done using a grade-school algorithm, but multiplication is implemented using Karatsuba's algorithm.
* [purescript-simple-parser](http://www.github.com/thimoteus/purescript-simple-parser): a simple parsing combinator library mostly inspired by Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer's *Monadic Parser Combinators*. Features include backtracking-by-default, several optimized combinators, and a module for many combinators that will work with different parser representations. Its optimized "many" combinator exploits tail recursion to give a fast, stackless way to parse many values, which in several cases is faster than any other parser library in the PS ecosystem.
* [clicker-builder](http://www.github.com/thimoteus/clicker-builder): An incremental/idle clicking game, in the spirit of Cookie Clicker. Makes heavy use of lenses to access and update game state. Written using Halogen, a purely functional counterpart to tools like React.
* [purescript-ordinals](http://www.github.com/thimoteus/purescript-ordinals): Data types for transfinite numbers. For when boring finite numbers aren't enough.
* [literate-purescript](http://www.github.com/thimoteus/literate-purescript): A transpiler that enables literate programming for purescript. Source code is written where the code (instead of the comments, as is the norm) is marked as special, and comments are not. It can parse code marked with surrounding ticks, blocks indented by four lines, and code preceded by Bird tracks. It is self-hosted, meaning it all the source files are written in markdown, then transpiled to purescript source code, and then built to a new executable.
* [purescript-difflists](http://www.github.com/thimoteus/purescript-difflists): a Purescript library for using <em>difference lists</em>, which have constant-time appending on the left- and right-hand sides, but transform to ordinary Cons lists in linear time.
* [covaur](http://www.github.com/thimoteus/covaur): an Arch Linux AUR helper meant to replace the browser. Instead of searching the AUR for a package in your browser, reading the PKGBUILD, and cloning from the url, all those options are given in covaur via a command line interface.
* [purescript-simple-request](http://www.github.com/thimoteus/purescript-simple-request): a Purescript wrapper around the client part of purescript-node-http, but with a more typesafe and easier API.
* [purescript-reddit-api](http://www.github.com/thimoteus/purescript-reddit-api): a Purescript library for interacting with [Reddit's API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api) via purescript-simple-request. Uses a monad transformer stack of StateT, EnvT and Aff. Automatically handles OAuth login, token renewal and rate limiting.
* [purescript-symbolic-differentiation](http://www.github.com/thimoteus/purescript-symbolic-differentiation): a Purescript library for symbolically computing derivatives of "real"-valued functions. Supports taking the Taylor expansion of a function to some finite number of terms.
* [purescript-markov-chains](http://www.github.com/thimoteus/purescript-markov-chains): a Purescript library for creating Markov chains from arbitrary orderable data structures, with extra features for strings.
* [JARAW](http://www.github.com/thimoteus/jaraw): an earlier library for interacting with Reddit's API, but more suitable for use with Javascript. Written with Iced Coffeescript.
* [RAADB](http://www.github.com/thimoteus/raadb): a library for using **R**eddit **a**s **a d**ata**b**ase, written in Javascript. Intended as a database replacement for hobbyist projects only.
