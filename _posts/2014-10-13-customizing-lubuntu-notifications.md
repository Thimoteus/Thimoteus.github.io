title: Customizing Lubuntu Notifications
----

By default, Lubuntu uses `xfce4-notifyd` for desktop notifications. If, by chance, you use a desktop theme that renders notifications unreadable, you can configure the notification window by running `$ xfce4-notifyd-config`. Change the theme to something readable and you're all set!
