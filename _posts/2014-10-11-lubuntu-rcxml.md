As it ships, Lubuntu's default `~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml` file has some outdated/non-working commands in it. Unfortunately I haven't catalogued all of them as I've slowly updated my rc file, I figured it would be better just to post it all [here](https://gist.github.com/Thimoteus/083187eaac6840e25504).
